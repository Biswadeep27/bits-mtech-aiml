I was so insatiable
Til the lights came on
And the stories got old
Now there's no one here I know
And the city outside's
Not the same anymore
And I..

I remember when we were young
We'd write our names in the sand, so carelessly
Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine, it stands alone.

Nobody sees me
Now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then
Now this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now.

And the music always played
With the sound of our lives
And the sweetest escape
And the neighbours would complain
We would turn it up louder
Who cares anyway?

Cause we-
We remember that we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
Had we made our castles and kingdoms up?
Now the waves have torn them down.

Nobody sees me
Now I'm a one man show
guess I'm heading home now.
